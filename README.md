# Discord2HTML

Discord bot for logging set channels to files every 30 seconds, as an cheap and easy method for me to edit files on my website on the go (or let others do the same). Markdown is supported.

**Usage**

Copy `config.example.toml` to `config.toml` and enter the appropriate values for the bot you would want to run this on. 
Then, get [Golang](https://go.dev/) (and optionally, [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)) run `go run .` or `screen -S DISCORD2HTML go run .`
